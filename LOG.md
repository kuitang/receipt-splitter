### Initial Setup and Core Implementation

**Completed Tasks:**

1. **Django Project Setup** 
   - Created Django project structure with `receipt_splitter` configuration
   - Installed dependencies: Django, Channels, Daphne, OpenAI, Pillow, python-dotenv
   - Configured settings for media files, static files, and session management
   - Set up .gitignore and .env files

2. **Data Models Implementation**
   - Created Receipt model with UUID primary key, 30-day expiration
   - Implemented LineItem model with proration calculations for tax/tip
   - Added Claim model with 30-second grace period
   - Created ActiveViewer model for presence tracking
   - Successfully ran migrations

3. **Landing Page**
   - Built responsive landing page with upload form
   - Integrated Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling
   - Added HTMX for progressive enhancement
   - Created base template with mobile viewport optimization

4. **OCR Integration**
   - Implemented OCR service using OpenAI Vision API
   - Added mock data fallback for testing without API key
   - Structured data extraction for receipt items, totals, tax, and tip
   - Image preprocessing and validation

5. **Receipt Editing Interface** 
   - Dynamic item editing with add/remove functionality
   - Real-time proration calculations in JavaScript
   - Save and finalize workflow
   - QR code generation for sharing

6. **Claiming Functionality**
   - Name entry with collision detection
   - Item claiming with quantity selection
   - Running total calculation
   - Grace period implementation for undo

7. **Testing**
   - Wrote comprehensive unit tests for models
   - Created view tests for main endpoints
   - All 15 tests passing successfully
   - Validated HTTP endpoints with curl

8. **Additional Features**
   - Tailwind CSS styling throughout (mobile-first)
   - Image generation script for DALL-E sample images
   - Proper error handling and validation

### Architecture Decisions

- **Django + HTMX**: Chose server-side rendering with progressive enhancement for simplicity and reliability
- **SQLite**: Using for development, easily switchable to PostgreSQL for production
- **Session-based auth**: No user accounts needed, session cookies track users per receipt
- **UUID URLs**: Cryptographically secure sharing without sequential IDs

### Known Limitations

- WebSocket real-time updates not yet implemented (Django Channels configured but not connected)
- Payment integration planned for future version
- Manual receipt entry fallback UI not implemented

### Next Steps

- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time claim updates
- Add manual receipt entry form for OCR failures
- Deploy to production environment
- Add payment platform integrations
