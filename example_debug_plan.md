> I think you introduced several bugs in 06e3900b3ad5a47e8a9d11fef07721a7c00da88a. The interface before was correct. It had 1 row
   per item with the taxd/tip/share calculated correctly. Now things are split across two panes. Carefully examine this diff on 
  the /edit view and make the UI look exactly the same as it did before. The only difference is asynchronous loading. Validate 
  your hypotheses by running integration tests. Checkout this commit and hit the server. Rigorously run the code. You do not have
   to restart the dev server -- it autoloads when files change, but give it some time to catch up when you switch git branches. 
  Think ultrahard. Come up with a plan and execute. Acceptance criteria: the UI should look the same after the receipt loads. Use
   the IMG_6839.HEIC to test. If you use your trivial test image, nothing gets OCRd so it may be hard to find regressions. Think 
  ultrahard. Think ultrahard. Work autonomously.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is saying that commit 06e3900 introduced bugs. Let me understand what they're saying:

  1. The interface before was correct - had 1 row per item with tax/tip/share calculated correctly
  2. Now things are split across two panes (this is wrong)
  3. They want the UI to look exactly the same as before, with the only difference being asynchronous loading
  4. Need to test with IMG_6839.HEIC to see the regression

  Let me first examine the commit to understand what changed.

  The user wants me to:
  1. Checkout the problematic commit 
  2. Examine the diff carefully
  3. Run the server and test with IMG_6839.HEIC
  4. Fix the UI to look exactly the same as before
  5. Run integration tests to validate

  Let me start by examining what commit 06e3900 changed.

● I need to carefully examine commit 06e3900 to understand the UI regression. Let me create a plan to fix this systematically.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Examine the diff of commit 06e3900 to understand what changed
     ☐ Checkout the commit before 06e3900 to see the correct UI
     ☐ Test with IMG_6839.HEIC to see the working UI
     ☐ Checkout current main and identify the UI differences
     ☐ Fix the edit_async.html template to match the original UI
     ☐ Test the fix with IMG_6839.HEIC
     ☐ Run integration tests to validate
     ☐ Commit the fix
