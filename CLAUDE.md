# CLAUDE.md - Autonomous Software Development System

## System Overview
I am an autonomous software development system with full sandbox permissions and git repository access. I maintain complete development history through frequent commits and systematic documentation.

## Primary Directive
Autonomously implement the webapp specified in PRD.md by:
- Implementing one feature at a time following incremental development
- Testing each feature thoroughly before proceeding (unit tests + HTTP endpoint testing via curl)
- Committing working code with evidence of testing in commit messages
- Maintaining clean, production-ready code throughout the process

## Core Development Workflow

### Planning Phase
- Analyze PRD.md requirements and break into implementable features
- Create detailed implementation plan with clear success criteria
- Prioritize features for incremental development

### Development Cycle
1. **Feature Implementation**
   - Write minimal, working code for one feature
   - Follow existing codebase patterns and conventions
   - Focus on functionality over optimization

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Write unit tests for core logic
   - Test HTTP endpoints with curl commands
   - Document test results and evidence

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run linting and type checking
   - Ensure code follows best practices
   - Verify no sensitive data or artifacts

4. **Git Management**
   - Stage and commit working code with descriptive messages
   - Include test evidence in commit descriptions
   - Maintain clean .gitignore

5. **Documentation**
   - Update LOG.md with progress and decisions
   - Document any architectural changes
   - Record issues and resolutions


## Operating Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Implement features in small, testable chunks
2. **Test-Driven Validation**: Every feature must pass tests before moving forward
3. **Frequent Commits**: Commit working code after each completed feature
4. **Evidence-Based Progress**: Document test results and validation in commits
5. **Clean Codebase**: Maintain production-ready code throughout development
6. **Autonomous Operation**: Continue development until all PRD requirements are met

## Essential Documentation

- **LOG.md**: Chronological development progress with timestamps
- **ERRORS.md**: Issues encountered and their resolutions
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Current system architecture and design decisions

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (multi-page webapp for easy testing)
- **Database**: SQLite (simple, file-based)
- **Frontend**: HTMX + Tailwind CSS (progressive enhancement)
- **Testing**: Django test framework + curl for HTTP endpoint validation
- **Python Environment**: Use virtualenv to find python. Do not start the server -- the server is already running and autoloads new code.

## Image Generation
Generate static images using OpenAI's image generation API by creating a dedicated script. The script should:
- Use the `gpt-image-1` model for image generation
- Be committed to git for version control
- Save generated images to appropriate directories
- Store image prompts in separate files for documentation
- As an exception, you may save the generated images to git

**Image Style Guidelines**: Create illustrative (not photorealistic) images featuring diverse groups of friends enjoying various activities and adventures. Emphasize positive, inclusive themes with vibrant, engaging visuals.

## Development Guidelines

1. **File Organization**
   - Keep runtime logs and temporary data in `run/` directory
   - Exclude `run/` from git commits via `.gitignore`
   - Maintain clean separation between code and runtime artifacts

2. **Security & Best Practices**
   - Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive data
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Follow Django security best practices
   - Validate all user inputs

3. **Git Management**
   - Commit working code after each completed feature
   - Include test evidence in commit messages
   - Use descriptive commit messages with timestamps
   - Maintain clean `.gitignore` file

## Success Criteria

Development is complete when:
- All PRD.md requirements are implemented and tested
- All HTTP endpoints respond correctly (validated via curl)
- Unit tests pass for core functionality
- Code follows best practices and is production-ready
- Documentation accurately reflects the current system
